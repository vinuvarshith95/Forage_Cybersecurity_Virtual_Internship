# 🛡️ Commonwealth Bank Cybersecurity Virtual Experience (Forage)

Welcome to my repository for the **Commonwealth Bank Cybersecurity Virtual Experience** hosted on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). This virtual internship provided a hands-on introduction to real-world cybersecurity tasks within the context of a major financial institution.

## 📌 Overview

This program simulates the role of a **Cybersecurity Generalist** at **Commonwealth Bank**, guiding participants through practical challenges focused on fraud detection, incident response, security awareness, and penetration testing.

The tasks in this repository reflect my work and learning throughout the experience, presented as blog-style reflections, technical reports, and visual deliverables.
