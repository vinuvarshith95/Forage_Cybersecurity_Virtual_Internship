# TCS Forage Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program

Welcome to the repository documenting my journey through the **Tata Group Cybersecurity Analyst Virtual Experience Program** hosted on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/).

## Overview

This virtual job simulation, designed by **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**, offered a hands-on introduction to the role of a **Cybersecurity Analyst** with a focus on **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.

As part of the simulation, I took on the responsibilities of an **IAM Developer**, working with a simulated global tech company called **TechCorp Enterprises**. The experience involved real-world inspired tasks aligned with enterprise cybersecurity practices.

## Tasks Covered

### Task 1: Understanding IAM Fundamentals
- Explored the key concepts of IAM: digital identity, authentication, authorization, SSO, and the principle of least privilege.
- Studied real-world IAM case studies in healthcare and finance industries.

### Task 2: IAM Strategy Readiness Assessment
- Evaluated the IAM maturity of TechCorp.
- Analyzed IAM readiness in areas like compliance, user lifecycle management, and access controls.

### Task 3: Designing Tailored IAM Solutions
- Developed IAM solutions to enhance user lifecycle management and tighten access control.
- Proposed automation, RBAC models, MFA integration, and approval workflows.

### Task 4: IAM Platform Implementation Plan
- Created a roadmap for deploying a scalable IAM platform.
- Addressed technical and organizational challenges around integration, monitoring, and optimization.

## Key Skills Developed
- Cybersecurity Strategy
- IAM Concepts (RBAC, ABAC, MFA, SSO)
- Access Governance
- Compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
- Enterprise IT Architecture
- Security Implementation Planning

## Tools & Concepts Used
- IAM Design & Architecture
- Risk & Compliance Analysis
- Security Auditing
- Real-world Simulation via Forage

## Final Thoughts
This simulation gave me hands-on experience in enterprise cybersecurity and a deeper understanding of IAM's role in enabling secure digital operations. It has strengthened my passion for the field and my readiness to tackle real-world security challenges.
