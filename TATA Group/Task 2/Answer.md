- Assess MFA coverage.
- Identify gaps in provisioning and de-provisioning processes.

### 4. Assess Compliance and Governance
- Check alignment with regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR).
- Evaluate audit capabilities and access review management.

### 5. Integration with Systems and Cloud
- Ensure IAM integrates with legacy systems, proprietary tools, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, etc.).
- Include support for SSO and federated identity.

### 6. Focus on User Experience
- Evaluate the simplicity, consistency, and efficiency of user access processes.
- Cover both internal and external users.

### 7. Security and Risk Management
